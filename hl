Inspired by novels from both the East and the West.
All famous ones. etc.

Solo Leveling is a very interesting science fiction novel from the West. The plot revolves around:
The protagonist and his army of shadows
sololy saving the world.

Iron Man (Avengers Endgame(Freedom fighters)) and Batman (Justice League), 
novels from the West, also help save the world and global society.

It can be seen that most popular novels, 
when adapted into high-budget films for theatrical release today, 
where the world has numerous film-watching channels,

often connect the story from Earth to the universe. 
And if it goes as far as using magic or occult sciences, or even different dimensions, 
to attract attention, it is usually used to ensure the film's high level of success.

I think this is a summary of how science fiction is made.
